# Arduino Leonardo/Uno based USB to Serial mouse converter 

Requires a basic USB Host Shield, a Leonardo or Uno Arduino, and the hacky voltage leveling circuit (there are FAR better ways to do this, I just had parts on hand).  Source for that is from [my repo which is forked](https://github.com/kroy-the-rabbit/ps2serial)

A repo outlining the code and design for an Leonardo/Uno based USB to Serial mouse converter.
